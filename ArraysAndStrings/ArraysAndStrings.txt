1.	When to use String vs StringBuilder in C#?
Ans: Use String for simple, infrequent modifications, and when working with small or fixed-size strings. Use StringBuilder when you anticipate many changes to the strings.
2.	What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
Ans: The System.Array class.
3.	How do you sort an array in C#?
Ans: I can sort an array with Array.sort() method provided by the System.Array class.
4.	What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?
Ans: “Length” can be used to get the total number of elements in an array.
5.	Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
Ans: The class is designed to store elements of a single data type. However, you can achieve the effect of storing multiple data types in a single array by using an array of ‘object’ type.
6.	What’s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
Ans: 
-	‘CopyTo’ copies elements into an existing array from a specific index. ‘Clone’ creates a new array with the same elements.
-	‘CopyTo’ does not create a new array; it requires an existing array. ‘Clone’ creates a new array.
